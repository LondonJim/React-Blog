# Learning more React and testing with Jest!

Currently in process of creating React Todo but playing around with and experimenting with Jest/Emzyme as I go.

## Instructions
Add todos in the 'Add new todo' text area, to remove a todo click on it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Current tests using Jest/Enyzme
